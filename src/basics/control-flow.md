# Control Flow

Control flow structures in Go determine the order in which statements are executed, providing the foundation for creating dynamic and responsive programs. Let's explore the essential control flow mechanisms in Go.

## Subpages

1. **[If/Else](./if-else.md)**
   - Use conditional statements to make decisions in your code. The if/else construct allows you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

2. **[Switch](./switch.md)**
   - The switch statement simplifies complex conditional constructs. It provides a concise and readable way to express multiple conditions.

3. **[Loops](./loops.md)**
   - Loops allow you to repeat a set of statements until a specified condition is met. Learn about the different loop constructs in Go, including for and while loops.

4. **[Defer](./defer.md)**
   - Defer allows you to postpone the execution of a function until the surrounding function completes. It's often used for cleanup tasks and ensures resources are released appropriately.

Explore each subpage to gain a comprehensive understanding of how control flow structures empower you to write dynamic and efficient Go code.
