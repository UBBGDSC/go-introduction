# Introduction

## Welcome to the GDSC UBB Go Workshop!

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting on your coding journey, our workshops are designed to empower you with valuable skills and insights. 

**GDSC** is a global initiative, and here at UBB (Universitatea Babes-Bolyai), we foster a collaborative learning environment where you can explore new technologies, connect with like-minded individuals, and enhance your coding prowess. 

This workshop, focused on **Go** programming, offers a unique blend of foundational knowledge and hands-on experience. You will be presented an intro to Go as a whole and then we will engage together in an exercise designed for learning basic aspects of professional back-end development. 

Join us for an engaging exploration of Go, and let's learn, code, and grow together within the GDSC community! ðŸš€âœ¨
