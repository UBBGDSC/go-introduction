# Context

Go's `context` package is designed to facilitate the cancellation and timeout of operations, particularly in the context of concurrent and networked applications. It provides a standardized way to pass deadlines, cancellations, and other request-scoped values across API boundaries and between processes.

## Example Usage:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func operationWithContext(ctx context.Context) {
	select {
	case <-time.After(2 * time.Second):
		fmt.Println("Operation completed successfully.")
	case <-ctx.Done():
		fmt.Println("Operation cancelled due to timeout or cancellation signal.")
	}
}

func main() {
	// Create a context with a timeout of 1 second
	ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 1*time.Second)
	defer cancel()

	// Perform an operation with the created context
	operationWithContext(ctx)
}
```

In this example, the `context.WithTimeout` function creates a context with a timeout of 1 second. If the operation within `operationWithContext` takes longer than the specified timeout, the context's `Done()` channel is closed, and the operation is canceled.

Go's `context` package is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple goroutines or networked services need to coordinate and manage the lifecycle of operations. It provides a clean and consistent way to handle cancellation, deadlines, and other contextual information.
